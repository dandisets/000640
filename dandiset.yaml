description: Male Long Evans Rats 7-12 months of age. 24 total animals. 256 sessions.  13
  animals received a frontal traumatic brain injury (controlled cortical impact).
  11 animals received Sham (no craniotomy no TBI) conditions. One week later, rats
  underwent a second surgery to implant 32 electrodes (Francoeur et al., Front. Psychiatry,
  2021). Rats were trained to perform a self-paced probabilistic reversal learning
  task in a custom operant box with five noseports, stepper-motors to deliver water
  reward, houselight, and auditory tones. Local field potential (LFP) streams recorded
  simultaneously from 32 Brain Regions - recorded using a 32-Channel RHD headstage
  coupled to a RHD USB interface board (Intan Technologies). Open Ephys software at
  1KHz band-pass filter set at 0.3-999Hz during acquisition. Lab-streaming-layer (LSL)
  was used to integrate physiology data with behavior. Physiology can be time-locked
  to trial onset (rat responds to start trial), response (rat choice between noseports),
  reward (time of reward delivery)
